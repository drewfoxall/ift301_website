      Welcome to my webpage! I am currently a college student at Arizona State
      University, studying Information Technology. Outside of that, have a
      strong passion for gaming, cars and photography. This is the webpage that
      I've created to display my photography. I specifically love taking photos
      of cars, nature, and quite frankly anything that I find beautiful in
      nature. I hope that you enjoy the photos I have taken!
