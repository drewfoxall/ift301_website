              Welcome to my webpage! I am currently a college student at Arizona
              State University, studying Information Technology. Outside of
              that, have a strong passion for gaming, cars and photography. This
              is the webpage that I've created to display my photography. I
              specifically love taking photos of cars, nature, and quite frankly
              anything that I find beautiful in nature. I hope that you enjoy
              the photos I have taken!

              I love to walk through nature and take it all in one step at a
              time. My journey of photography has done a lot in the ways of
              teaching me to slow down, and appreciate what is around us. This
              is my main goal when it comes to photography, to spread some of
              the beauty that is around us every day, but that we may sometimes
              turn an accidental blind eye to.
